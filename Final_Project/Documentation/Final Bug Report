Final Bug Report
================
There are not many bugs to report in the Frogger game. At one point in time the car class was not working. Though it seemed like the code was setup properly, there was an error with a void operation. However, this bug is now closed which means that it is no longer a problem in our game. One bug that was previously fixed was the “Static Image” bug. The car class was up and running, however the red car image obtained a static quality when it moved across the screen. Luckily, this is not prevalent anymore. Another problem occurred with the start screen. If a player uses their mouse to click a certain part of the screen, the instructions screen will appear while the player is in the middle of a game. This is a problem because a player’s game will end if they accidently click the screen. Then the player would have to start their game all over again. One final bug we have to report is that after the game ends, the frog still appears on the start screen, which it should not. Our team has worked vigorously to eliminate all of the remaining bugs.
